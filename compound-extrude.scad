  compound_extrude provides a tool to create an extended extrusion, with both straight and curved sections, that stack consecutively.

  calc_normal_placement_mat

  This function calculates the transform necessary to take an item from the extrusion base (i.e. the origin by construction), to a point "offset" from the center of the extrusion in "dirAng" direction, at any distance along the entire extrusion

  parameters:
    summary - the output from an earlier "summarize_segments" call
    totLength - the target length along the total extrusion for the placement
    offset - the offset from the center (i.e. translated origin) of the placement
    dirAng - the direction axially from the extrustion in which the offset is applied
    segAddr - an optional alternative to totLength, which interprets numbers such as 1.55 to mean "55% along the length of segments[1]"

    returns a 4X4 matrix which can be used with e.g.
      multmatrix(res)cube();

  summarize_segments

  This function creates a list that summarizes/characterizes a segment list (note that the input segment list IS in fact included in the output as summary[4])

  parameters:
    segments - a list of straight and curved segments
      For a straight segment [len, color] where color is optional (i.e. len(straightSeg == 1 || len(straightSeg) == 2)
        len - number >= 0
        color - (optional) color string
      For a curved segment [curveR, curveAng, dirAng, color] where color is optional (i.e. len(curvedSeg) == 3 || len(curvedSeg) == 4)
        curveR - number > 0, the radius of curvature of the segment
        curveAng - number, the angle in degrees swept out by the segment
        dirAng - number, the angle in toward which the segments curves (default for dirAng = 0 is along the x-axis)

  returns:
    summary - a list with 5 elements
      [0] - a list of aggTransforms to the beginnings and ends of each segment (the matrix to the beginning of segment[i] is aggTransforms[i], and the matrix to the end of segment[i] is aggTransforms[i + 1]), meaning that len(aggTransf)
      [1] - a list of individual segment transforms the origin to the end of the segment, given that segment starts at the origin (these can be multiplied together to get the aggTransforms)
      [2] - aggSegLengths, a list of the aggregated lengths before and after each segment (like aggTransforms, there len(aggSegLengths) = len(segments) + 1)
      [3] - segLengths, a list of the lengths of each segment
      [4] - the input segments themseleves (dirty but useful)
    returns a 4X4 matrix which can be used with e.g.

  compound_extrude

  This function generates the extrusion from a list of segments that define the extruded segments, which is applied to a 2D surface. This surface can either be supplied directly with a list of "points" which are used directly to create a polygon (e.g. "compound_extrude(points, segments);", or, if no points are supplied, it will be applied as a transform to a 2D shape (e.g. "compound_extrude(segments)circle();")



  (note that "paths" and "convexity" are other polygon parameters that can optionally be supplied) 

  This function creates a list that summarizes/characterizes a segment list (note that the input segment list IS in fact included in the output as summary[4])

  parameters:
    segments - a list of straight and curved segments
      For a straight segment [len, color] where color is optional (i.e. len(straightSeg == 1 || len(straightSeg) == 2)
        len - number >= 0
        color - (optional) color string
      For a curved segment [curveR, curveAng, dirAng, color] where color is optional (i.e. len(curvedSeg) == 3 || len(curvedSeg) == 4)
        curveR - number > 0, the radius of curvature of the segment
        curveAng - number, the angle in degrees swept out by the segment
        dirAng - number, the angle in toward which the segments curves (default for dirAng = 0 is along the x-axis)
    
    points - (optional) a list of [x, y] points that are used to define a 2D polygon
    paths - (optional even with points) option used by polygon (see official docs)
    convexity - (optional even with points) option used by polygon (see official docs)

    summary - The first thing that compound_extrude does is to generate a summary with "summarize_segments" which defines all the transformations used. This summary can be generated separately by and inserted directly as a paramter here, in which case "compound_extrude" will use the supplied summary aggTransforms blindly, and not recalculate any of it. Note that any modifications applied to the summary[0] = aggTransforms will manifest in the resultant extrusion.
